<h2>Accounts</h2>
<p>If you want to use the OpenShift Origin Index, you can browse and download quickstarts and cartridges without an OpenShift or GitHub account, but if you want to add items to the Index, 
you'll need a GitHub account AND if you'd like to launch an quickstart or cartridge on OpenShift Online, you'll need an account there</p>
<h2>Searching</h2>
<p>You can search all the quickstarts and cartridges that have been submitted and have publicly active github repositories. If the github repository isn't publicly active then it will not show up in the search results.</p>
<h2>Launching</h2>
<h2>Adding</h2>
<p>Basic data about your project will be pulled in from Github such as language, data created, last update, # of watcher, stargazers and forks - which is used to rank your project activity. Each quickstart or cartridge to be added should be avaliable as its own Github repository.
For example, if the quickstart is located at http://github.com/myusername/myquickstartname, put 'myusername' in the first box and 'myquickstartname'in the second. For all quickstarts, we will need you to tell us which cartridges are required to create the application. For more information about how to create a quickstart or a cartridge, please refer to the getting started documentation for more information.</p>
